  ## THE ORIGIN OF HOME


  Maria Sofia Emma Piacentina de Arsena Eisner is known to her 11 children and 34 grandchildren as Sofia. She doesn’t quite reach five feet tall, she’s quietly perched in an orange chair, rounded against the curvature of her spine. 


  It’s not her house, but it could be. Pictures of her are scattered around it, some with her hair long and brown, then short, now silver and wiry framing her face. There’s one photo on a yellow-tinted wall behind her. She’s standing tall with her late husband, Peter, as he fishes with one of their sons and a few of his children, their grandchildren. It’s about a decade old by its fray and color.

  Sofia looks as at home as ever in the house of her oldest son, Jorge, in Chaleco, just outside the city limits of Buenos Aires. It’s picturesque. As she talks, she looks at the long pool through the tall window, teeming green grass and the tiniest breeze surrounding her, drifting into the house. She remembers the birth of all 11 of her children, meeting her 34 grandchildren (split right down the middle, 17 girls and 17 boys). 


  She scoffs and describes herself as “nothing,” while blowing a raspberry and looking off into the lush bushes bordering the pool. Not Argentine, not Italian, not one, not the other —but she’s the opposite of nothing.
